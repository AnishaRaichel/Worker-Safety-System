## 🧠 Features
- Fatigue Detection (ML Model) – Predicts worker fatigue using physiological and behavioral data.

- Heat & Humidity Alerts – Identifies environmental stress using temperature and humidity sensors.

- Proximity & Access Monitoring – Detects critical zones and unauthorized entries.

- AWS IoT Integration – Publishes alerts to the cloud securely using certificates.

- Real-Time Dashboard – Streamlit-based interface visualizing alerts, metrics, and trends.
